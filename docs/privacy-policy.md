Thovar Studios Pty Ltd (“Thovar Studios,” “we,” “us” or “our”) operates the Thovar Discord Bot (the “Bot”).

- **User** or **you**: any individual or entity that installs, configures, interacts with or subscribes to the Bot.  
- **Personal Data**: any information that can identify you directly (e.g., Discord user ID, email address) or indirectly (e.g., usage logs).

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 From Discord
- **User and Server Metadata**: your Discord user ID, username, discriminator, avatar hash, server (guild) IDs and roles.

- **Indirectly** through Discord’s API and our server logs.  
- **Automatically** via cookies or analytics tools on any web dashboards we provide.

## 4. How We Use Your Information

- **To Manage Subscriptions**: enable, suspend or cancel premium features and send billing receipts.  
- **To Communicate**: send you important notifications, security alerts, or support responses at the email you provide.  
- **For Analytics**: analyze aggregated, anonymized usage trends to guide product development.

## 5. Disclosure of Your Information

We do **not** sell or rent your Personal Data. We may share data only in the following circumstances:

- **Service Providers**: third-party vendors (e.g., Stripe, ImprovMX, hosting/CDN providers) who process data on our behalf under strict confidentiality.  
- **Legal Obligations**: when required by law, legal process, or to protect our rights, property or safety, or that of others.  
- **Business Transfers**: in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, provided the acquirer agrees to honor this Policy.

## 6. Third-Party Services

The Bot may integrate with third-party APIs or libraries (e.g., Google Analytics, Sentry, Stripe). Your use of those services is subject to their own terms and policies. We encourage you to review their privacy notices.

## 7. Data Security

We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures, such as encrypted TLS connections, access controls, and secure server configurations, to protect your data. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection against breaches.

## 8. Data Retention

- **Usage Logs & Analytics**: automatically purged after 90 days.  
- **Subscription Records**: retained for as long as necessary to support billing inquiries and comply with tax or legal requirements.  
- **User Metadata**: retained until you remove the Bot from your server or request deletion.

## 9. International Transfers

Your information may be transferred to, stored and processed in countries outside your own, including Australia, where our servers or service providers operate. By using the Bot, you consent to such transfers under applicable data protection laws.

## 10. Children’s Privacy

The Service is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from minors. If we learn that Personal Data of a child under 13 has been collected, we will delete it promptly.

## 11. Your Rights and Choices

- **Access & Correction**: you can view or update your user profile data by removing/re-inviting the Bot or contacting us.  
- **Data Deletion**: you may request deletion of your Personal Data by emailing us (see Section 14).

## 13. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Policy at any time. When we do, we will revise the “Last updated” date above and post the new version. Your continued use of the Service after changes become effective signifies your acceptance of the revised Policy.
